Nicole Henry,"December 31, 2020",2,"This app needs to be updated to be optimized on the Surface Duo. My story posts don't appear correctly on my friends' screens. Also, when in landscape mode, the app is very thin and there is a static on the side of the app. It is very scary looking. Please fix this! Now with new way the app is for posting, I cannot even post! If I try to select multiple there is no way for me to select additional photos. They REALLY need to fix this screen orientation stuff. It seems like it's not that diff",275,,,

So I have had some issues in the past with IG, such as: it was freezing, the filters didn't work and sometimes it wouldn't even let me open the app. But then a few months ago I updated it and everything was fine until now. My filters won't work at allüòîüòêüòû. But it isn't overall a bad app. It works just fine but I would love to know why my filters are blocking. No hate just wanted to asküòÇüòÖüòä",247,,,

However, now the app will not open at all! I've researched how to fix it, and have also tried the ways others suggested, but nothing works. I've also spoken to others, and they said their app is working perfectly fine, so it's just mine. Please let me know how to fix this issue!!",241,,,
Dina Phan,"December 31, 2020",2,"Can't seem to change the layout of my images/videos. I tap on the ""square/rectangle"" icon in the bottom left, but on the next screen, it just goes back to the square option. Not ideal for videos, or landscape photos. New layout of buttons is also silly. Don't need the reels or shop button there. Post button should be back in the middle.",16,,,
Anthony,"December 31, 2020",4,"Great app for both learning a thing or two, and unwinding. There's one hitch I've come across thus far...volume. On my Android 10 device, holding down the volume up/down button (in-app) doesn't gradually increase/decrease the playing media's volume. I have to click the buttons multiple times, or click them once and then use the on-screen volume slider to either raise/reduce the volume. It's a little annoying ‚òπÔ∏è",46,,,

Rich Audet,"December 31, 2020",1,"Aspect ratio for android is broken, especially on igtv. I made my video 1:1 and it still forces a zoomed in version.

I understand from a business standpoint the shop icon being at the bottom may draw more attention... but the most utilized icons should be at the bottom.",9,,,
HoneyPleb,"December 31, 2020",4,"This is a great social media app, it's great and it more accessible for young aged people who don't have a phone number since you can access it with you gmail/email, you can also message friends on this app which is really cool, but there are some bad sides to this, first sometimes I can't access the page for some reason, second is that sometimes I can't find the pictures I took in my gallery and sometimes it also won't let me post my photos.",33,,,
Matias Suarez,"December 27, 2020",1,"This app got a lot worse than it was. Not only has the layout changed into something no one asked for, scrolling has become uncomfortable, algorithms changed into something silly, and features that aren't relevant were shoved into it.

Why this feature is no longer available is beyond me.)",66,,,

Plus I think that the latest updates were and are useless and just made to make ''new'' stuff.

Jus V,"December 26, 2020",4,"Instagram is a great app. Many influencers use it and we can be updated to what they do or where they are. But I only give it 4 stars is because of the translation.

This happens no matter what wifi I am on, or if I am on data, so it's the app. Please fix this",21,,,
Megan M,"December 30, 2020",1,The new update sucks. The notification bar at the top is stupid. The fact that you have to click on the story icon to post on your page is ridiculous. Plus you can't save drafts anymore? You can switch profiles in your notifications too? These are just reasons why I don't want to use Instagram anymore. It was good they way it was before. Why fix what's not broken? The new update is a joke.,33,,,
Siddharth Camarushy,"December 31, 2020",3,"A little disappointed by how glitchy the app is. I've got a display that goes up to the edges of my phone, but every time I want to make a story, the bottom fourth of my display isn't ever available for use. It used to work well, but it's just stopped ever since one of these recent updates. App gets a little less pleasant to use because of these things. But other than this, a good platform over-all. Does reduce reach a bit if I don't post for long, but still a good platform.",1234,,,
Shane Olean,"December 25, 2020",1,"Non-stop ads, ruined the notification section. Now the notifications act just like facebook. They don't show up until after you pull down to refresh the notifications.

Another issue is that you cannot post full screen videos anymore. It just doesn't work. It's broken. You people continuously break features that have worked flawlessly for years!",1184,,,

Leanne,"December 25, 2020",1,"instagram has always given us completely useless updates instead of fixing what's already wrong with their app. so many glitches. story notifications are delayed, photos/videos disappear when you try to post them on stories or on your feed, and you can't even crop a single video or photo now when you want to post. instead of giving us a shop and gradient messages do something worthwhile that would actually make users' experiences better like hiring someone who actually knows how to do their job.",27,,,
Rose Coker,"December 31, 2020",2,Wow! I've been using this app for 2 years it's a great app but why isn't it working for me. As for me I would like to rate this app a 2/5 reasons why.

I can't own a website with my own name (which is the same as my Instagram username) WITHOUT INSTAGRAMS PERMISSION??? WTH. I bought it with my own money fair and square from a hosting site.

Though these are good, I've been starting to not get notifications from my gf. It's some weird glitch I just found. It's only towards her, no one else, and it's starting to become an issue.

I have much more to say, but I ran out of characters.",2366,,,

I have reported the issue numerous amount of times, and got no answer at all, I came to the app store to see that instagram basically doesn't care , doesn't reply to the requests for help even on the review.

Bahski,"December 20, 2020",1,"Updated their terms of service and now I'm deleting the app. Their new updated terms are so loosely defined that they have the right and capabilities to do pretty much anything they want with any of the days on your phone. Copy/Read your text messages, call logs, contacts. They can do live analysis on your camera. It's simply not acceptable in my eyes for another big tech company to take advantage of their platforms popularity. Maybe I'll come back to it when they've clarified their TOS.",102,,,

Connor Bostock,"December 21, 2020",1,This app used to be one of my favourites. However the recent updates have destroyed that. I feel like you guys have tried to make the app better and easier to use but instead have done the exact opposite and have actually broken the app in the meantime. I can no longer post videos (if I do they just show up black) and I can only tag people if I post 1 slide.

You used to be able to tap on it so it immediately shows you the page but now you have to copy the link and type it into Google.

Not only that, but now they're removing story shares?? Unbelievable. I'm extremely disappointed in Instagram and the people behind it.",40,,,

Aidan Coyle,"December 10, 2020",1,"New UI sucks, I'm never using Instagram for shopping, and reels replaced the post button.

Instagram is my place to go to get inspiration and find peace from all the stress I receive on Facebook.,4,,,

I get 30 likes at most usually. It went viral for a reason. Change instagram back and fix the algorithm we are all sick of being suppressed,4,,,

johnalan norris,"December 3, 2020",2,"The newest update is a real step back. It puts the useless/annoying Reels and store options in the highest priority space. This makes the usual functionality of Instagram harder to use. Also, the icons have thicker lines and the box they're in is just white. The contrast makes it look like another app is floating above my feed. I keep looking for how to close it. These changes make me want to use the app less.

Raul Gaina,"December 2, 2020",2,Lacks in functionality. Incredibly sub-par to the iPhone version. The overall design is nowhere near as good as the iPhone version of the app. Why can you not zoom in to a picture and hold the zoom with just one finger so you can keep seeing the majority of the picture? 2 fingers obstruct the view so much. Also why can't you zoom in to pictures send through direct message? That part is completely stupid. Have to waste extra time to save the pic so you can zoom in on it.,132,,,
