Rayanna Shrock,"January 1, 2021",1,The last month or so when I go to watch the screen ie black but the audio is playing or the scene judt freezes but the audio keeps going. I've checked for updates. I've used data and wifi. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've reset my phone. I've tried multiple wifi connections. Nothing makes a difference. I'm highly disappointed.,91,,,
meepawe,"December 31, 2020",2,"It doesn't let me watch. I know it may sound weird but i keep installing and uninstalling this app for one reason. It doesn't show me anything, only the caption. I have this installed in a year now and I have no problem since but recently it's bugging me. I don't know the reason why. It keeps lagging, though my internet connection is very well fast and speed. So yep, alwayslagging and I can't even watch and chill. I don't know what to do.",171,,,
Harry Bishop,"December 25, 2020",5,"I love the app. Love what it offers, but it is never free, in any way, shape or form. To be #4 free on Google is a straight up false statement. Period. Netflix isn't free. Nuff said. Free trial is only when you enter in your credit/debit info. Hmmm, free is only free, with strings attached it seems. Cancel, it is free. Forget, you now pay. Oops, on you. Better for them. Free means freely given. Or, call me a liar. Up to you.",717,,,
Shreya,"December 31, 2020",3,"Not able to play only one particular episode, while the rest can be played. Tried changing network but still only that one particular episode doesn't play. Also, everytime I pause on an episode and leave the app, and when I go back to it again later, it doesn't start from the place where I paused. Please fix the issues.",9,,,
Debbyani Chakraborty,"December 31, 2020",1,While signing up it is creating a lot of problems and i can't do it smoothly. This app deserves 5 star but sorry to say due to some problems i can't give 5 star. Infact this app is not working. It is not upto the mark as i thought it would be. Watching web series or movie would be better with friends or family but this sort of rigorous problems is totally abolishing my impression towards this app.,12,,,
Mursal Ali Hussein,"December 27, 2020",1,"Normally this would be a five star app in my eyes. But for some reason, the app has mysteriously refused to work. Everytime I've tried opening it i get hit with ""sorry, we can't access the netflix service at this time. Please try again later (-1001) error"" I've formatted my phone, reinstalled the app and tried using multiple different networks. Nothing has worked. I can log in fine from all my other devices. Just not my phone. I've tried contacting the support line, but they have been no help",392,,,
Michelle Hogarth,"December 15, 2020",4,"I love this app, but I think that 'My List' can be improved. I'd love to be able to add labels/categories to my list or even rank them. So I can easily find the things I saved to watch later. It should also to be easier to remove something from the 'My List' view, rather than having to click into a show and remove it there, and then when you go back to the List view it's lost your place and you have to start scrolling from the top again. Easy fixes that will really improve this feature!",1467,,,
Vidhi Thakor,"December 30, 2020",5,"Netlfix, as always is most amazing in it's way, though i would like to suggest that it should include a lot more legendary shows from all across the globe.

Thank you.",21,,,
Riley McGillivray,"December 26, 2020",3,"Good experience most of the time, but the app will not always keep good track of where you left off, especially if you exit out of the app without pausing. My main reason for the 3 stars is that it will sometimes have serious stop-and-start stuttering of the video. This isn't due to connection, because the problem persists on downloaded episodes. I'm on a pixel 3, so I shouldn't have a problem with any video player. This may be make it break if this continues.",312,,,
ÏõêÏä§guitarÏÇ¨Ïù¥,"December 12, 2020",3,"This is a very cool app. The recommendations are good, how each movie/tv show is sorted into categories is the best feature for me. Also, it connects flawlessly to my Google Chromecast. So far the only issue I have here is that it kinda gets messy if I add items to ""My List"", e.g., if I wanted to watch a movie I added a long time ago, I had to keep scrolling ridiculously to reach the far end where it's located. It can be improved by adding categories section to ""My List"". Hope this'll be added",649,,,
Cory Oliver,"December 14, 2020",1,This app sucks. It glitches all the time. It freezes up constantly and no its not my connection. I just did your update and it fixed nothing. And sad part Noone is going to respond to this. I won't be renewing my subscription if this doesn't get fixed. Not to mention your high prices for b rated and old movies. You should be ashamed of yourself. Netflix is nowhere what it use to be.,770,,,
Angela Broccone,"December 20, 2020",4,"The app works fine, but if I'm watching something on my phone and then close it out, it never starts where its supposed yoo, or it completely restarts an episode.

I do the majority of watching on my phone, and this is really becoming an issue. Please find a way to fix. This is something I've noticed pretty recently. It hasn't always been this way!",696,,,

Anmol Rout,"December 30, 2020",4,Netflix is a nice way of watching things that you can't find...but the reason I gave this four stars because I was literally watching Gossip Girl Season 3 when they decided to cancel it.

Robyn Vaughan,"December 25, 2020",5,"Next to YouTube, Netflix ranks #2 in my book of best apps ever created. I love that there are always new movie and TV show titles flowing in to keep the selection interesting, especially when something I love & haven't seen in ages pops up. I'll be like, ""I totally forgot about this movie! Let's watch it again right now!"" Times like that are the best because I know it's going to be a great night.

All my other apps work perfectly fine, as so does my internet, but whenever I try to watch something on Netflix, only the audio plays and the screen is either black or extremely laggy. I can still see all the viewing options for movies etc. It would be deeply appreciated if this issue would be fixed ASAP as I have money going down the drain right now for not being able to use the app to its full potential.",458,,,
Abel Solomon Taye,"December 25, 2020",4,"Great movie streaming up. Quality is good. Only issue that comes up is sometimes it will get stuck after you start a movie you had stopped watching. To fix the issue, just have to close the app and restart it. Easy fix but can be slighty annoying if you have started and stopped watching several times. Nonetheless very minor issue. Tons of choices to watch for the whole family.",259,,,
William Pearson,"December 28, 2020",4,A great way to watch some shows and movies! And some shows have lasted much longer than others! I can even watch shows on Netflix I cannot watch anywhere else! What I don't like is when the shows I like disappear and I wish many cartoons that were on Netflix were back! Fortunately some shows do come back! Cannot think of anymore to say but I hope I can continue using Neflix for a long time!,253,,,

Please don't make me resort to leaving Netflix and using Amazon Prime instead... cus we both don't want that to happen.",568,,,
encrypted cipher,"December 30, 2020",5,"This app is very useful. I use it on my tablet & it works as great as seeing this on my t.v / computer monitor.

Jayd√©-Lee Joseph,"December 27, 2020",4,"Although Netflix is amazing app, it does have a limited amount of choices and doesn't really include much of the latest movies and series and almost none of the ""oldies but goodies "".

Donald Chase dgc49,"December 8, 2020",4,"Not perfect, but getting better. I've been finding out that a lot of the issues we wear having in the past were due to WiFi issues here at the hotel. Since signing up with T-Mobile with the unlimited package, we are able to bypass the WiFi and use our phones as the wifi hotspot. All of the glitches we were having just disappeared. I do wish that Netflix would bring back the old TV serials like Adam-12, Emergency, and a host of other programs we used to enjoy.",434,,,
Reed Fry,"December 22, 2020",3,"This app doesn't seem to play nice with Chrome OS. It can't remember where I paused or exited, and restarts a series I'm watching at different previous paused points within the series. Amazon Prime and HBO streaming do not have this issue. So I tend to use those streaming services more often, even if I'm interested in Netflix's programming. Yep, still sucks. Still does the same thing. If it were free, I might ignore the disruptiveness. But as a paying member, it just kinda sucks.",45,,,
Bridget Makafui,"December 31, 2020",1,Great viewing experience until someone hacks into your account from a faraway continent. I kept getting notified that random users are logged on to my account from locations unfamiliar to me.

Samantha Farrell,"December 26, 2020",4,"The mobile search function is a little off. If I search for a specific item, I often need to scroll to find it, or it doesn't existed at all.

Zayan Ahmed,"December 9, 2020",5,"Netflix is all about getting together with family. Well with the series you always want to know what and well you find out and you are relieved.

parzival,"December 16, 2020",4,First of all i love the netflix app. I use it all the time and it has become my secondary source of entertainment (after youtube of course) and it is amazing. I personally have had no major problems with the app although some of the show selection are a bit questionable i dont have many complaints if any. My main annoyance with the app is the removal of the background play feature. You know the little switch beside the cast button. Unfortunately it was removed in a recent update.,357,,,
Manali Sankhe,"December 27, 2020",3,"I love this app. But few things I don't like are that it doesn't keep track of where exactly you left off. And it removed really good shows like That 70s show and others, and you cant watch movies.like Harry Potter series which is which are staple, go to movies. And since it doesn't have important up and coming shows, you can't solely use Netflix and have to rely on other services. It also has video lag when the audio is running. The new seasons for shows haven't been updated which sucks.",354,,,

Will Otu,"December 11, 2020",3,"Frankly a really good app. My experience, however, is marred by the display and the limited ability to make adjustments. The brightness, while warm, I find too dark. Made worse is whenever there happens to be text or subtitles, then the picture becomes an occluded background to the text. It's disappointing that the app overrides the native device display controls in this case. Also, creating some opacity in subtitles would be nice.",28,,,

Bradley Yardy,"December 13, 2020",1,"Recently the app had a feature to switch the video off and just listen to the program. It meant you could lock your phone or go on a different app while still listening to Netflix. It was great and I used it all the time.

My favorite bug is: it never remembers which episodes I watched when I close & re-open!
I always have to fast forward several episodes, sometimes entire seasons... In spite of their progress bars appearing in red, as in ""watched"".
If that's not a cool bug, there's the fact that it always gives me a huge full-screen screenshot whenever I exit any episode, and I have to exit & re-enter to see the episodes list & controls...

adam tortorich,"December 9, 2020",2,"Latest update has broken the app so that it no longer correctly keeps track of where you left off in a series/show. Every time I exit the app, and go back later to continue watching it always resets back multiple episodes from where I left off. For example I'm on Star Trek S1 E11 and about half way through, but when I close the app it starts back on E9 at the beginning. It does this for everything else too on both my phone and tablet but not the website on pc.",34,,,

In the future I would love to see a setting option displayed with the video that allows me to rotate it when I choose too. I personally keep auto-rotate off which is constantly conflicting with what the video is trying to do and even when I turn on auto-rotate it still won't go back to horizontal full screen.

Jessica McFadden,"December 11, 2020",5,I don't think there is much bad things about this app at all. It is good how you can make profiles for all your family members with the shows people they like. For children you can make their profiles only have PG and G rated films too which keeps them from watching inappropriate things.

If I had the speed changed, instead of remembering the setting it will revert to 1x speed. Worse, if I click on the ""continued watching"" instead of opening the video from downloaded videos, it will sometimes start me from a previous episode instead of the one I actually just watched.
