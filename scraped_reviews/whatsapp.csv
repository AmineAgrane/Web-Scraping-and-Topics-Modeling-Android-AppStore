Anushka Dutta,"January 1, 2021",4,"This app is really amazing with all its brand new tech features...yet I rate it 4 stars because I feel that you should add some more ordinary features such as one should be able to share an item to more than 5 chats, one should be able to share more than 30 images, you should also have a feature where we can see our chat to whom we have sent the most no. of msgs, pics, etc, and should also have a feature where we can search all the gifs as it is really irritating to scroll through all those gifs",1848,,,

Gladwin PM,"December 11, 2020",5,"Good. Very arranged app, simple to use. Great effort.

In my case our online classes are taken through Whatsapp so the teacher sends many voice msgs so when revising or listening to them later in search of a specific point will be much time consuming and boring.

So there are times we cannot speak about it to each other without spoiling it for them. So if the msg bar had options for setting what type of msg it is, you can have one that says spoiler msg and it blanks out the msg for everyone else in the chat and you can customize what it says in there. So you can write 'mandalorian spoiler alert' that overlays the msg box",123,,,

James McLean,"November 9, 2020",1,UNRELIABLE WhatsApp has been my messenger service of choice for many years. Unfortunately it now rarely receives calls on either my current or previous OnePlus phone. Problem seems to be a very slow call connection process which is requiring upwards of 45 seconds from dial to ring tone at the target. This is on high speed WiFi. Voice service on cell data is even more sporadic. Yes you do get a missed call notification but that's not good enough for a live messenger service. 👎,324,,,

Lee Davis,"December 2, 2020",1,"Well I give this app 1 star because there is no way to use it to sign into whatsapp desktop from the phone which in times of covid has become more and more necessary and some people exclusively use whatsapp but my phone isn't always available. Whenever I scan the qr code presented by whatsapp for windows whatsapp for android simply says to ""Use the WhatsApp scanner to scan this QR code"" because apparently the built in reader cannot do that. I've tried looking for the elusive WhatsApp Web scanner on google play, Apple App store, windows, through a google search, bing search, forums and have ultimately come to the conclusion that it doesn't exist if it's not already a part of WhatsApp for Android. So the *only* reason I am using this app with a lack of modern features, lack of UI appeal, for some reason doesn't give notifications (and yes I triple checked my settings, my phones OS is told to basically blow up whenever I receive a message and it doesn't with just this app) and a SEVERE lack of flexibility is because there are a few people that I need to get ahold of that use this godsforsaken piece of software that I can only use on 1 device and I can hardly even rely upon it.",133,,,
