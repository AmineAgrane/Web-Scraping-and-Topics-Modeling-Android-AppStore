Farman Ali,"January 1, 2021",4,"In my opinion spotify is better than any other app for streaming songs, but there are some issues I want to address. 1. First is the adds. You should limit the number of adds a user can see. Sometimes adds just keep on coming one after another. And when you stream the first song it asks if you want to see an add, so that you can listen to your songs for 30 min. non-stop, ok Understandable. But when I click on 'No thanks', it just keeps on showing me adds one after another.",171,,,
Gabriel Orrantia,"December 31, 2020",3,Something completely went wrong!!! I've been paying for Premium and I expect it to be worth my cash! Spotify won't play any music when I log in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and done everything I can think of. The online community doesn't even have anything to offer help wise. I don't know if it's the app or my actual phone anymore. I log in on another device and it works. Whats going wrong and how do I get it fixed?,93,,,
Andre Wessels,"December 31, 2020",1,"Very very dissapointed, I've been using this app for 3 years with absolutely no problem. But now it seems that times have changed. The app is starting to mute my music at random, not adjusting the volume, but simply doesn't play the song while the song shows that it's still playing. Not just that, but it reën removes a lot of my downloaded music now and again. Very sad to see this app end its life cycle.",231,,,
mia luvly,"December 30, 2020",2,"I love Spotify but lately I have been having some problems with actually listening to what I am playing. On speakers I can listen, but on the actual device I can't. I have tried logging out and signing back in, deleting the app and reinstalling it multiple times, and it still doesn't work. Reading a lot of these reviews got me thinking that Spotify has a problem with it's app on android devices. I hope they improve.",53,,,
Marissa Cimino,"December 31, 2020",1,"This app used to be great but after the update it will pause a song randomly, multiple times throughout the course of the song. And it does this for every single song i play. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, clearing the cache, and logging out of everything. Nothing works. I used to like this app a lot but lately it's more trouble than it's worth.",27,,,
S P Red Panda,"December 30, 2020",2,"Has a lot of ads, you can only skip 6 times an hour every hour (you can't save up skips), songs are added to my playlists, including the liked songs playlist (and they're awful songs, as well as ones I hadn't heard of or liked, which is why you need the skips) and if you want anything that makes the app in some way good, you have to pay for it. The only reason I won't delete it is because some songs that I like are posted there and not YouTube. But yeah. These issues aren't pleasent.",28,,,
A MT,"January 1, 2021",5,"Incredible application. This app has revolutionized my day, prior to installing, I would do work without music in near silence. I needed something to fill the void of that, and Spotify greatly substituted. On the daily I listen to my music, and immediately perked up. One criticism I have of this application is the limited amount of ways to discover new music. I wish discover weekly was instead discover daily, but that is of course not the case. 5/5 stars, would download again.",2,,,
Caleb Willems,"January 1, 2021",5,I love Spotify and have been paying for Premium for a few years now. The last glitch I experienced has been fixed. Thanks Spotify!,3,,,
Sarah Dunning,"January 1, 2021",5,"Seriously I'm so thankful for Spotify! Any and every time I want to slip away from reality weather it be at work or home or even just driving to the store, Spotify is always there for me!! I don't know what I'd do without music, and I'm so thankful I decided to finally give Spotify a chance!! Definitely haven't been the least bit disappointed!!!",3,,,
valentine,"December 29, 2020",2,"Spotify has been downgrading a lot over the past years, like many other apps. You are basically forced to get Premium to enjoy the app. Back then you had fewer ads and the only other downside was that you couldn't listen offline. Now you can't even fkcing choose what songs you want to listen to, which is this apps whole purpose??? Listen to the music you like?",34,,,
Christopher Nez,"December 31, 2020",1,"Complete utter GARBAGE!! I can't listen to a song I want for more than 10-15 seconds. It will automatically switch songs for no reason and gives me unknown artist that I have no clue who they are. I pay for the premium with no ads but I'm looking to get my money back. I have uninstalled and installed it 3 times so far and keeps doing the same thing. As I'm typing this review, the ap keeps opening up and playing music from random artists. This Complete BS! FIX THIS NOW!!",7,,,
Andres Pedrin,"December 29, 2020",2,"I like the amount of music is on the app and I also like a lot of the mixes. The way the app operates is garbage. It won't pause probably, especially for video. The time on the bar does not match the actual video. If I close the app it does not save where I left the video. A times the video will keep playing with no sound. Good format, bad operation.",17,,,
Mircea Mititelu,"December 30, 2020",2,"The quality of the app is close to unusable by someone who actually likes to listen a band/album. If you like to listen to useless crappy covers of the same song you just listened and stuff or to get stupid playlists, this is your stuff. Easier to have mp3s on the phone for the car or whatever. Plus they do not have a whole bunch of bands that can actually sing. 2 stars because it works.",10,,,
samantha medina,"December 31, 2020",4,"It was going well for a while, but recently all of my data was erased. My playlists, podcast, everything was gone. Also, I don't like how spotify won't let us see our emails/passwords. I've had to create several different emails and spent hours recreating a playlist when it could have easily been avoided. Overall though, it's a great app. (Edit: nevermid guys, its all back lol. i guess it was just updating, sorry Spotify)",2,,,
Louzet Legaspi,"December 29, 2020",3,There are plenty of songs to listen and it is great however I always encounter problem when they have an update. I cannot search or download any songs when they have an update and it always says no connection when my internet is working perfectly fine. Hope you can look into it and fix it. But anyway it is a great app to find and listen songs especially when you are in premium.,11,,,
Natalie Torres,"December 31, 2020",2,"Update issues Since the last update the running time of the song stops, but the song keeps playing. Also, when connected to my car if I push to forward 10 secs, since the running time stays the same it goes back to that time. The same problem happens when not connected to car. It makes it especially confusing when listening to podcasts. Need help.",8,,,
# CYN1CAL_SOURZ,"December 28, 2020",1,This app was good but it's up in flames now. Want to listen to a song too bad sit down and wait for it to randomly shuffle play even if your playlist has more than a thousand songs. Did I mention you can skip songs? Not like it matters anyway you get about 6. oh they also give force you to listen to music that isnt even on your playlist. and that's not the best part 2 skips in you get smacked in the face by wave of ads and when your fresh out you have to wait an hour just for 1 extra skip. Sad!,42,,,
Barefoot_ Boi,"December 31, 2020",2,"I do enjoy that I can listen to most of my music using this app but it isn't real efficient. I get an add after listening to every song and it is quite frustrating. I also think the app would be more efficient if you could type a lyrics of a song into a search bar and a song would be found for you, just a recommendation. I dont reccomend this app.",7,,,
Nicholas Butler,"December 29, 2020",1,"The app is actual trash. I've used spotify premium for 8 years on Android, and it has only gotten worse. It takes several minutes to load the app even when the vast majority of songs are download to my device. It's gotten to the point where I expect it not to load any song when I open the open to listen to music for a short drive in the city where I live, with plentiful reception.",32,,,
onewapani,"December 30, 2020",1,"I cannot log in. When a verification link is sent to my email, I click on it immediately and it says the verification link has expired. I've tried to reach customer support, but you have to log in to even talk to them. Obviously this is a problem because I can't log in. The system is made for you to go in circles without answers. Spotify, do not respond to this with an automated message that says contact support. Been there, done that, can't log in therefore I can't even get any support!",10,,,
i,"December 31, 2020",1,I used to use Spotify all the time and had to unsubscribe due to the amount of tech problems. The app is slow and playlists don't load. You'd think with one of the best engineering teams apparently in the world it would be more consistent. I am having problems with both the desktop and mobile app. Also my account got hacked into so they obviously dont enforce high security standards. I never write reviews however wanted to show how disappointed I am with this. I welcome alternatives...thanks 😊,4,,,
Beth Rippen,"December 30, 2020",1,"I'm a fan of a lot of the content on Spotify, but the app will randomly and repeatedly pause or close without me touching my phone. When I'm doing dishes/gardening/handling raw meat/etc. that's extra aggravating because I can't just start it up again right away. No way am I paying for a subscription when the only way I listen doesn't work well.",14,,,
Tod and Heather Sprague,"December 30, 2020",2,"I generally love Spotify, but I am starting to get seriously tired of the CONSTANT issues with the app working!! I can have full bars and the app will say I'm not connected to the internet....I can open the app and everything looks fine, but it refuses to play; restarting the app never works, restarting my phone makes it work occasionally and I seem to have to uninstall then reinstall the app at least once a week to get it to work.",11,,,
Melissa Hanson,"December 31, 2020",4,I've been using this app for a couple of years. Just recently I've been having trouble keeps saying its offline and I've made sure it's not and I have internet connection still says I'm offline. I tried logging out and logging back in but when I put password in just tells me I'm not connected click to connect then tells me it can't do it t this time.,4,,,
Miranda Thomas,"December 31, 2020",4,"Paying for premium is worth it. I love the wide array of podcasts available. Playlists are easy to create and I've only ever encountered two or three songs that I wanted, but were unavailable. My only issue is that the app becomes unbearably slow over time. However, a quick uninstall and reinstall solved the problem for me.",2,,,
Claire Valente,"December 30, 2020",2,4 years of premium Spotify was good but it's going downhill l and I plan to cancel in March and find a better alternative. My frustrations are: 1. It now plays silence quite often. It seems to be Spotify checking if you're still listening. Inconvenient if you're eg washing the dishes. 2. It made me start a new contract until March when my bank card expired in Oct. Instead of updating the payment details. In hindsight I should have cancelled. 3. It played an ad yesterday - on premium. Unreliable,4,,,
Stuart Kahler,"December 31, 2020",1,"Even if I download audio, it won't start playing until it connects online. It also locks up most of the controls and display when I listen to long podcasts to the end. Like I get out of my car (bluetooth disconnect) and it starts playing again and I can't shut it off. Force closing the app doesn't work. I have to fully reboot my phone to make it work again. No picture in picture like youtube is a major disappointment since I'm forced to use this terrible app to listen to Joe Rogan now.",3,,,
Yasmin Houston,"December 29, 2020",3,"Ok, why is it that when i make a playlist it gives me random songs? And i can't even take them off, like why? I also don't like how you can only preview the songs, why cant you just tap them then you're able to listen to the whole song. But it's good because you don't need internet to listen to your songs. It has a lot of songs to choose from and any song you need your sure to find it there, like the app lots and it has its cons but its a good app.",10,,,
Hugh Crissman,"December 29, 2020",1,"As a music streaming app, this app is acceptable. As a podcasting app, it falls terribly short, bordering on barely functional. I have been super disappointed. The list of problems related to podcasts are too numerous to list, but here's a few. Offline mode is laughable. Downloaded podcasts still use streaming unless you go into settings to toggle to offline mode, then need to toggle back for music or other content. Podcasts loose progress when switching between various modes (car mode, video playing mode, audio only, and playing via android auto). As much money as they are dumping into podcasts, you would think they would put serious effort into refining the app to manage podcasts better. I couldn't be more frustrated. Unfortunately, due to exclusive deals, they are holding my favorite podcasts hostage.",10,,,
Marsh,"December 29, 2020",1,"Its good, could be better -There needs to be a separate/master library for songs, so its easier to refer back to all of your downloads in one place. -Making playlists is an awful experience. You should be able to choose multiple songs at once to add to your Playlist. Picking a song one by one is time consuming.-android version needs to have a way to interact with Spotify via the drop down menu, like Samsung music does. -I paid for premium. I should be able to do things any other music app does",5,,,
Donie A realy,"December 30, 2020",2,"Pay for Premium but still get Ads in Podcasts. Spoken Ads in Podcasts are pain and should be removed when you pay for premium. Otherwise, what's the point? The App is very glitchy. Plays songs when the App isn't even active. Shows one song while playing another. Tracks and Podcasts skip/stick on a regular basis. I have waited for Spotify to fix these issues as there are alot of reviews saying the same thing. Unfortunately, this hasn't happened. Downloaded Acast. Hopefully it's better!",3,,,
Lucy-Anne Webster,"December 28, 2020",3,"I have premium and it's great. But why can't you use playlist folders on mobile? I had a few xmas playlists that I didn't want cluttering up my library for the whole year, so put them in a folder to keep them out the way (using the desktop app). But when I go on mobile, the folder says it has 0 playlists in it and all the xmas playlists are just out in my library? I looked it up and a lot of people are complaining about folders not working on mobile. It's so stupid and annoying pls fix this :(",4,,,
Jimmy Alderman,"December 28, 2020",2,"I switched to Spotify from Google Podcasts for a podcast that recently went Spotify-exclusive. The Spotify app has been incredibly frustrating to use because of the bugs. To name a few: it will randomly switch to other podcasts, it will not save the spot I finished listening, it will get stuck on an ad that won't play, it will randomly crash. It works but these bugs are small annoyances that build up over time.",6,,,
Joe Slaughter,"December 27, 2020",2,"I've had spotify for about a year, and it's had so many bugs recently, I'm seriously considering moving to some other music app. half the time my downloaded songs won't play, or I have to go completely to airplane mode for anything to even load even though my internet is fine, and it's so annoying. updating the app and restarting my phone doesn't work. I feel like I'm constantly yelling at it, ""what are you doing??"" I really do like the app, but it's so ridiculous now",32,,,
Ruben Rodriguez,"December 30, 2020",1,I would like to echo some of the other comments here. The app would be great if it were not for all of the bugs. The app regularly gets stuck with the song information for one of the songs and does not change when the music does. The only way to get it out of this is to force stop the app or restart my phone. This becomes frustrating because if I hear a new song that I like I have no way of knowing who the artist is. I will give one star until this is fixed. I'm afraid that if it is not fixed soon I will have to uninstall the app.,7,,,
Aarushi Kalra,"December 26, 2020",4,"It's a really great app to listen to music whenever you feel!! I am not even annoyed from the ads that much 😅 But just I think you should add those songs also which are available on YouTube and are from growing artists with lesser fans. Also, please try to work on the method of making a playlist..it is too much time consuming. Overall..I am really happy from this app and I am using it since it was launched in India 😄",9,,,
kyle degroff,"December 29, 2020",1,Used to love and brag that I have premium on spotify. I pay for no commercials but now they put commercials in the podcasts when they are in the middle of talking. Ruining the whole experience of the podcast. I will gladly pay again when this is fixed. But for now I'm canceling because I'm not getting what I paid for. Very disappointing.,5,,,
Alex Purtov,"December 31, 2020",3,"It's great for compiling your own playlists and finding artists and everything, but the whole recommendation thing is not good... All daily playlists consist of the same stuff day after day, with like 5 new songs. The same goes for recommendations based on your playlists,even after refreshing the same stuff comes back. Likes/dislikes don't help to filter anything out either, so it's quite annoying sometimes to be hearing the songs you don't like everyday. And I'm using premium version btw...",0,,,
Barrie Wilmot,"December 31, 2020",2,"I've had an issue twice now where podcast episodes simply will not play. I can play music, I can play literally anything else besides podcasts. I've cleared data, cleared cache, and the only thing that's worked is to fully delete and reinstall the app. The worst part is that this time I was listening to a podcast when it happened - the episode ended and the next one simply wouldn't start. Tried multiple different podcasts and nothing.",3,,,
Ennards Exotic Butters UnU,"December 28, 2020",4,"I love the app, but I have a few problems.Some ads go twice in a row, them it asks you to watch one to not get them for 30 minutes.And that sometimes doesn't work.The playlist organization annoys me the most,since it's always the ""recommend"" ones in your playlist,I prefer if they were in order,like when you first added them or last added them.and last problem, the song September for Jeff The Killer is basically non-existent.

Pull down and lock screen player controls stop working frequently, and the only way to get them back is to restart the device. All notifications are allowed in the app settings.

Eve 918,"December 28, 2020",5,I enjoy listening to music through Spotify app. It is my favorite music service. I have found many old songs here and have added them to my different playlists so I can play them whenever I want and also share them with my family and friends. Spotify didn't disappoint me on Christmas either with its many Christmas songs all throughout the whole month of December. Spotify is the app for me. :-),9,,,
pavan datta,"December 29, 2020",3,"I would very much like to give you a 5 star rating, but you got some serious flaws. I am using spotify premium for a while I like to ho on to trips with my favorite songs downloaded, but then I couldn't hear them if I can't login through online, seriously! Why would I downloaded em if I could just have internet in Remote areas. Also when I have a long trip where I can't have access to internet, then boom, lost completely.

Bernadette M,"December 13, 2020",1,"It worked fine until about a month ago. At first it said that there was a connection issue, even though there wasn't cause I could still surf the web and watch videos on youtube, so I couldn't play any new songs that weren't already on my playlist. But then it slowly started to unsave the songs I liked until ALL of my liked songs couldn't be played anymore even though I'm on premium.

aidil haikal mohamad kassim,"December 30, 2020",1,"Overall good experience using spotify. Been paying premium for years, obviously to avoid the ads. Recently, my spotify has been glitchy e.g., playing songs that are different from what is being shown, unable to pause when outside of the app, non responsive to my galaxy buds trying to pause it too, etc.. Spotify, please look into this issue. I've tried restarting my pphone multiple times. The issue persists. I am convinced it's due to your recent update Please help your loyal customer here",3,,,
Samantha Mun,"December 26, 2020",3,I do love and this is the only music app I use but it's been 10 hours since it updated and I'm already pissed since if you have already 'played' a podcast you could just put it in your queue and it just play again but now you have to go make it as unplayed just to listen to your podcast. And it's also the new layout isn't nice either since they changed it so if your starting straight with it you'll be fine. But if you've been using this app for a while the layout has changed alot.,8,,,
Sahil Fageria,"December 31, 2020",3,"Disappointed The library on Spotify is literally huge, the interface is amazing, quality is great.

I sincerely hope this gets rectified soon.",1,,,

Also, for whatever reason half the songs are not playable; they're technically playable (not greyed out) but do not actually play.",25,,,
Ruhani Jindal,"December 22, 2020",4,I love this app but I wish we could see the names of the people who follow our playlists. I also wish we could comment on a playlist to compliment the person who made it. In this way Spotify users can interact with each other and bond over their favorite songs.

Luca,"December 28, 2020",3,"great app, love spotify, but this app is extremely slow and unresponsive when offline mode isnt on; my playlists and other things take minutes to load sometimes, takes a while for songs to play and overall is very frustrating for when i dont want offline mode turned on. fix this please because im using youtube to listen to music more and more because of this.

Nubia Ambrossi,"December 15, 2020",2,"I've had spotify premium for an entire year. Recently changed my plan to the free version. I seriously don't think this app is usable unless you pay. You get an overwhelming amount of ads. There will be times where they will put around 10 different ads. Not to mention, they ""give"" you an option to skip ads if you aren't interested in listening to some ads to receive 30 minutes of no ads.

You used to be able to watch a short video and then you had 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. NOT ANYMORE! Now it's up to FIVE ads BACK-TO-BACK every 3-4 songs. It's ridiculous! I stopped watching regular TV for this same reason. I get it. You need money, but more ads will just drive users away. Maybe I'll just uninstall.",998,,,
Tilly Lilly,"December 27, 2020",3,"It worked perfect and I would get 30 minutes of music after an add when I got it a few years back but this past year they've started doing a few ads instead of one, which would be fine but its turned into getting 5 or 7 adds then only 10 minutes of music (I watched the time!)

It's crashing increasingly frequently, first while I pressed something, now even during playback with the screen locked.

Sometimes it works, and when it does, spotify is one of the best music streaming services I've used. It's utter garbage 70% of the time.",34,,,
Jade Rodeck,"December 11, 2020",1,"This app keeps getting worse. Half the time it won't load, just sticks on the loading screen or a black screen. It lags when trying to play a song, leaves me with no music. When it finally does load and does play, it randomly stops mid song. It's not worth the money anymore",12,,,
Anna Alaman,"December 30, 2020",5,I have updated my review. Since a month ago I can see an improvement from the App and I dont face more issues. So quite happy with the new app updates. Old review October 2020 I have a lot of issues with the App. I cannot even log in. Everytime I request for a new password it sends me a link which it is already old. So I can not reset it. It says also is offline. I can not enjoy it since few weeks ago. Dont know how to solve it.,315,,,
Vera Cardoso,"December 10, 2020",1,"Only giving 1 star to get some attention. I've been using this app for years and generally it delivers great value for what I pay. However, for the past month or so, it became virtually unusable. After I start playing a song or a podcast and have an app running on the background, it pauses every few seconds and I have to touch the screen again and again so it starts playing. I updated all the settings to allow for background streaming but it's still happening. Please fix!",429,,,
Sana Parhiar,"December 19, 2020",4,It's a good app and all but there's too much ads there's an ad after every 2-3 songs and now it's 2 it used to be 1 ad only but it's 2. Please can you change this it will make it more enjoyable for the listener. And for playlists I don't hear every song in mine either fix this to but other than that it's a good app to stream your favourite songs.,2,,,
Kittykat Loves Cake,"December 29, 2020",5,"This is a amazing app! I really recommend this app. It can have play lists and podcasts. The only downsides are actually very important. If you try to play some of they songs, it plays a different song with a totally different name. It also has ads everytime you close and then open the app. This is a really good app! Please fix the problems! :)",479,,,
James Cook,"December 21, 2020",5,"It works well enough. It could be a little more intuitive when you want to play through Sonos, and to play an album in its actual sequence rather than only seeing only the big Shuffle button. It doesn't say anywhere to simply tap on song 1 and it plays in order, but that's how it's done.",2,,,
Tiffany Moorer,"December 27, 2020",1,"I first noticed this problem probably back in August but I thought I was just tripping. Every once in awhile I would click a song and then lock my screen and all of a sudden a different song than what I clicked with play.

Maree Bujdegan,"December 29, 2020",4,"I like this app although it is incredibly annoying that the female voice stating that ""the next 30 minutes is...."" is ALWAYS at a very high level - much louder than either the following advert or the music.

No its not my speakers because Pandora or Youtube Music do not have this problem. I Love this app, but it is so frustrating i choose the others 95% of the time.",2,,,
Kyle Clark,"December 28, 2020",1,"More bugs than any other app I've used. The only reason to pay for this app is for the pc version, which rarely has bugs that make it completely useless. I've had to reinstall the android version more times than I can count just so I might be able to listen to music for a week before having to reinstall it. It constantly just doesn't play music at all or switches playlists for no reason. There is genuinely very little reason to use this app with the poor state it's been in for years now.",45,,,
Louise Green,"December 16, 2020",1,"It's gotten worse. The app went from pausing and unpausing to now adding random songs or sounds to my liked playlist that aren't even related to my music style and playing them over and over again (of cause being the only ones that work). On top of that the songs are no longer downloading, so I'm aren't able to listen to any of my music I paid premium for, because it won't work off the internet or data any more.",2,,,

Shoshi B,"December 16, 2020",5,I absolutely love the Spotify app. I can link seamlessly between my devices and pick up right where I left off. I don't pay for it so they can mire you down with the same commercials but they change the monthly and they only last about a minute or 2. Totally worth it. It's FREE! I love that I can find any music I want and play it at my convenience (for the most part) and make my own playlists. I can't live without it.,12,,,

Umairah Anuar,"December 22, 2020",4,"This app has been my favourite music player for a long time! And I still love it till now. The reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 though is because sometimes when I play a song and pause it, it'll still continue to play the song even when the play button shows that it's paused. It'll also continue playing it even when I left the app. I don't think its because of my device since I've used it with other devices and the same problem happens, its not often though.

Surenderaj Yuvaraj,"December 15, 2020",3,Pros: - Great app to listen songs. - Easy song search. - All songs that i have listened are clear. - Using premium account is very convenient as no Ads to disturb. Cons: - Worst app to use while riding bike. Especially if u have your phone in your pocket or bag. On random days the Spotify automatically stops working even if we changed it Offline mode. Unfortunately have experienced it frequently. This issue happens on Android and IOS phones. - Downloads downloaded songs everytime.,1,,,
RayPlays,"December 26, 2020",2,Spotify sucks because you have to get premium just to skip more than 6 times. Spotify is essentially a cash grab but the music is making me use it more than I would so I wouldn't recommend using spotify unless you listen to music all the time or you're a creator. I would rate it 1 star if I were you unless you like it which you will not.,2,,,
Sidharth Singh,"December 11, 2020",3,It's good but some features are definitely needed. I usually listen to Japanese podcasts and songs but still I cannot choose to like Japanese songs by language. Since the availablity to play exists so should the search and recommendations. More general YouTube Hindi playlist need to be added. We always need to search each song Individually. Taking another star off for that black circle on logo. Destroys my material design look.,7,,,

There's also only a few songs and able to listen to. So that means that I can't listen to any of my favorite songs.

PsycrowXIII Arts,"December 29, 2020",1,App was really awesome in the beginning (when I first installed it less than a month ago) now it wont let me pick individual songs like it used to. Now I'm stuck having to skip songs and only getting the ability to skip so many times. I like this app more when I could pick the album I wanted to listen to and pick a singular song out of said album. Now I have to listen to songs I dont wanna hear in order to get to a particular song I want. For a time this was better than YTmusic. Now I'm not sure,44,,,
James Piercey,"December 15, 2020",1,"When faced with a pause, asking me if I want to hear an ad for 30 minutes of music, I click the seemingly explicit ""No Thanks"" option, only to be met with three whole ads. I actually can't see how that's okay, but I'm sure theres some loophole someone can phrase to make sense. The freedom to make your own playlists is great, but that one bit gets on my nerves to no end because of how frequent it is. Yes, I know you want me paying for Premium. No, I'm not going to. Quit faking a choice in ads.",50,,,
Richard McCullough,"December 16, 2020",2,Just doesn't work all the time. Very slow to start up. Seems like connection issues but I have a connection.

Seany D,"December 19, 2020",4,"I love this app I ain't gonna lie Glad I upgraded to a paid subscription but, when I wasn't, when I liked a song, it would have the heart next to it, so then I knew what I'd listened to, but when I upgraded, the heart disappeared where I'd then have to click into the song to see if I'd liked it or not. Not a massive deal, just made listening to my daily mix's that get made for me a bit more annoying to know what I've heard & what was new for me to enjoy. Still live it though 😁",1,,,
Anna Borg,"December 17, 2020",3,"The user experience of Spotify is all over the place - it always feels like the different product teams are not communicating.

I also just realized today that a song I KNOW I have ""loved"" was no longer marked that way. I marked it again. Came back later, and it was un-loved again. Whuddaheck?",75,,,

Michael Bragg,"December 11, 2020",5,"My son used Spotify all the time. I never thought much about it until my cell provider offered 6 months free. Its no longer free but it's worth it.

The option to create playlists with the FREE version is the best but I'm just an old Napster hack. Really, I just like their style. Thats why I'd recommend📻",79,,,
Ricardo Castrejon,"December 31, 2020",3,The UI isn't as garbage as it once was but it's still a far cry from what it originally was.

Sena,"December 27, 2020",4,"This is a great app for listing to music! I love how it's all free and how you can get most of the songs you want!

Gretchen Holden,"December 19, 2020",1,"I only got Spotify for school but ended up creating some of my own playlists.

I tried listening to a playlist with only two songs on it, but it didn't play neither of those songs. And what really ticks me off is that I can only skip six times per hour??

David Fallon,"December 16, 2020",5,"This is a pretty good app. Wish I could use it to hold all my mp3 files like I could with Google Music, but this is much easier to use than the free version of YouTube Music, which replaced Google Music, and it runs very well on all my devices as does the web version in Chrome browser.

I also hate that I'l make playlists with 40+ songs and only get five repeated when I shuffle. I can't play the playlist without shuffling either.

Ashwika Mahajan,"December 20, 2020",5,I just loved the app. It's just amazing and unusual. Even satisfactory too.

Carisa Hubbard,"December 15, 2020",1,I've had the paid service for years. But the app rarely works on my phone.

Aaron Vandenberg,"December 17, 2020",3,"Spotify has a feature called your daily mix. It serves you multiple new daily playlists of music that can also be set to automatically download.

Joshua Jones,"December 15, 2020",5,All around great music app. My only complaint is that it's not completely free - but nothing ever is.

Jeffin Vloggers,"December 14, 2020",2,Actually I've Amazon Prime Music. I'm not planning to uninstall Spotify from my Phone. The reason why I switched to another App where I get all the priviliges is only because of the advertisement. Good advertisements are to be presented to the users in a standard way. In the case of Spotify it's so irritating. An advertisement is brought to me every 3 minutes. I think Spotify can present this in a better way than this. I think this is happening only in India.,22,,,

It's a small thing, but I drive a lot and I honestly find it really annoying. But it is a great app, I just wish that the voice talkback would be optional",21,,,

zach lightle,"December 12, 2020",2,I've been a big fan of Spotify and used it for 2 years or more by now on my phone to listen to music. Due to financial problems I've had to cancel my premium and am now learning what it is like to use the app without. Now my opinions on it have completely switched and I find Spotify completely intolerable to use for music. If it wasn't the only place for me to hold on to all of the songs I listen to I would just delete it. Now I look up the songs I want of on it and leave to use YouTube instead.,9,,,
Tyler Moodley,"December 17, 2020",2,"The app itself is really good. The reason I give it two stars is because of the ads. I had no problem with the ads a year ago. Now, it gives me the same ad.

I get that you're trying to make money, but at least have a little variety in the ads.",55,,,

Making your own playlist is fairly easy and, if you don't mind shuffle play for a huge list with the occasional ad, free is a real option. Or it was. The shtick, for as long as I've used the app, is a volluntary opt-in ad for 30 minutes of ad-less music. Bit of a lie as of late, ruining any desire to keep listening.

I use to have one of the other pay premium music apps and it did not offer near as many of the live recordings of my artists. I really enjoy hearing a live album from time to time and this is the place to get that if you grew up in the 60s 70s and 80s. The depth of their music library has no end which makes it amazing for all genres of music. This really comes in handy when your a music lover and very eclectic.,32,,,

dorito senpai jr,"December 21, 2020",4,Well guys having spotify premium is a unique experience it doesn't lag it doesn't have ads and you don't have to skip 6 times/H and I'm not giving it 5 stars because it is still not perfect they can add more features to it such as put only lyrics on genius and many more.

Ryan Staffaroni,"December 29, 2020",4,"Freemium ads suck; get Premium.

Maxi Bravo,"December 23, 2020",3,Ads play every 3 songs. That's not bad but for someone who has over 1000 songs in their playlist it's sucks and puts my mood away while I wait for the ads to end.

Another thing is how podcasts are shoved into your feed. I don't like them, I don't listen them, and have no idea if I can even hide them because UI of the app is atrocious. Since it's creation, spotify navigation is as pleasant as wiping with charred stick would be. Not so great. Terrible to be honest. Last thing, I was would be working, was algorhythm, which used to be really cool, giving interesting tunes and bands to check but even that got wrecked somehow. If by chance, I wanted to listen to one particular song once, it will be coming back and forth each week but if I listen to certain songs on and on, I won't get any suggested playlists which actually could be linked to those tracks.

Also if you want to listen to one song in general you have to get premium then you can do that or you have to make a whole playlist with different songs too.

I thought, perhaps i didn't have enough songs on the playlist! But when i added like abt 18 more songs (totalling to about 34 songs), after 2 songs again, it played another ""suggested song"" , and to be able to continue hearing songs on that playlist, i had to either waste a skip or suffer through that awful song.

Joseph Gray,"December 19, 2020",5,"The single best music app available, as long as you pay for it, not that expensive especially with the family pricing.

Luca Silvani,"December 18, 2020",1,Spotify is a terribly organized platform and I only downloaded for JRE and all I've had is issues with the app. Fully downloaded podcast pause at random times more than enough times for me to write a review which I've never done.

Carmelle Latour,"December 30, 2020",4,"I have only been using Spotify for a week and they want a review. I am in my three month free trial. I think, for all you get, it is worth $10 per month. I can listen to whatever I want whenever I want. It is kind of like shopping on Amazon. There is so much it is hard to find what I want. It takes a lot of searching. I don't like the play lists it makes for me. I would rather make my own. I probably would have given it three stars if I hadn't tried Pandora first, which really sucks.",2,,,

Mr. Gulunduludulo,"December 17, 2020",1,"Unusable without premium. I feel like I spent more time listening to ads than music. Literally got four 15-30 second ads in a row plus the ""want a break from the ads"" one which is one or two more ads depending one whether you watch it or not. You also cannot listen to specific songs and playlists throw random songs in with whatever you put in there. Its only use is exploring genres, because the shuffle feature forces you into listening to a bunch of random songs.",5,,,
Tom Paquette,"December 12, 2020",1,"A lot of hardwork has been put into this app and I think it's worth paying for premium, but then I learned how little the artist makes.

Dustin Eberhart,"December 31, 2020",1,"As others have said, it skips to the next song after less than half a song, or it just stops playing all together. It's been that way for me for months now.

Dannessa Ayala,"December 13, 2020",4,"This app is amazing, I've used it for so long and it's so simple to use. I just really hate how you only get 6 skips per hour, without premium. I have to listen to a old song in my playlist that I'm not interested in anymore, and I'm usually too lazy to remove it, because then I'll never replay good memories, and I'll never find the song again. It makes me want to stop using this app, cause I'd use it daily.",9,,,
Amber S,"December 17, 2020",5,I've tried the competitors like Apple music but they simply don't compare to Spotify. It's layout is simple and it's compatible with so many platforms.

Slime Cookie,"December 22, 2020",4,If you want music to listen to. I recommend downloading this app. You can add playlists and you could listen to the songs you like all the time! But I give it a 4 star as the ads are to distracting and everytime you have to pick up your device to check what's going on and all you see is an ad. I understand that ads make people aware but still if you could shorten the amount of ads as well that would be nice!,17,,,

The other is whenever I go to an artist's albums they aren't in order of release.

Thomas Frankish,"December 16, 2020",2,I liked the app until I opened the app to find that it won't let me listen to the music unless it is on shuffle and they added a lot more songs that the app just assumed I would like I made those play list to listen to the music I like than add any new song that I start to like. What's more if I want to listen to a certain song on repeat in my playlist I can't do it anymore if they could fix this it would be great.

mergame,"December 22, 2020",1,The app used to be great for finding new music but has changed the UI so it is basicly impossible to judge if you like an artist or not. Before you used to be able to tap on the list of songs below the shuffle button and you could here a short demo of every song but now they have goten rid of the option so it takes 100× longer to get a feel for the music why would they do this. Discover weakly is good but I want to find music on my own sometimes.,1,,,
Jasmine Turner,"December 23, 2020",5,After having this app for several months now I noticed that the way we listen to music is totally different from the way we use to listen to music.

Cristian Ghita,"December 24, 2020",2,"The bad: Spotify has gone from great to crapp due to their aggressive add interruptions. In practice, Spotify feeds you 2 disturbing commercials each 2-3 tracks. Is now worst than YouTube. User interface is so & so. In lanscape mode (e.g. tablets) the information is displayed in a verically manner instead of horizontally, which is stupid. One third on the display is practically not used. The good: Ok if you pay for it, but lossless or HD not available for long time now. Spotify Connect is great.",1,,,
Kimberly Davis,"December 14, 2020",5,"I love Spotify, I don't even need Premium. I don't mind 1 minute commercials. It's an easy app to maneuver. I have premium now. I like not 🚫 having to choose Shuffle Play. Very easy to create playlists.",1,,,

Epic Swag,"December 25, 2020",4,"I have enjoyed the app a lot so far but the only thing I'd recommend is changing the shuffle play feature, it doesn't even play it randomly like I'd prefer. It plays it in the same cycle every listen and it just gets old.",0,,,

Mrinmay DebBarma,"December 17, 2020",3,What is the point of premium other than no ads. I don't understand why we can't download any songs we want.

Aditya Rai,"December 31, 2020",4,"The app works good, however it could be better if you could select the lyrics (from the Lyrics section of the song) and the song would play from there as against using the main toggle for moving the song ahead/behind.

Lily Prosch,"December 24, 2020",1,Glitchy AF. And my acct keeps getting hacked. Not my device (of all my apps only Spotify has issues). So that tells me its on their end.

David Wicks,"December 12, 2020",5,"Songs now days as far as lyrics, are to political in nature and much of the social subject matter says if you don't agree with the message something is wrong with you.

I like smooth jazz because its more about the music than the lyrics, without the music its just poetry.",2,,,
Brittany Shepard,"December 17, 2020",2,Every time I open the app my playlist is stuck on the same song.

Aman Rayet,"December 10, 2020",3,It is a good app the only downside is no shuffle play really the ads are nothing compared to youtube and all I really want is the ability to choose songs but it is still a decent app. If you are upgrading to the premium version I would go with youtube music because you get youtube premium and youtube music premium for the same price. It's ok but overpriced in total which is why I'm sticking with free version.,13,,,
Lani Valencia,"December 26, 2020",1,"I did the free version, but i still should be able to pick if i want to listen to a specific song. Not have to listen to a whole playlist of songs i didn't even choose. And the whole 6 skips and hour is stupid.",0,,,

Ian Clark,"December 25, 2020",5,Great app whether just listening on the free version on shuffle or otherwise.

You are flooded with 3 to 5 ads after like 3 songs which blows. I highly recomend soundcloud",0,,,
M vN,"December 21, 2020",4,Great content and selection. I grew up with cd's so having access to pretty much every song I want for $10 per month is an unbelievable deal.

Surgical Gamer,"December 7, 2020",1,"if u don't have a premium account Spotify is not for you. ads in YouTube are perfectly fine, about 20-40 secs in like a 20 min vid. in a Spotify free account u get about 1+ min ads after 2-3 songs so its like 8 minutes of music and 2 minutes of ads. it didn't used to be like this, i used to get only one 30 sec ad in like 12-15 min but now its gotten really annoying. if Spotify doesn't reduce ad Count, i will stop using it and switch to some other app. ohh and lastly size of app is too much.",1,,,

Anant Agarwal,"December 15, 2020",3,"Good app, I have few suggestions though. 1. Same track is allowed to be added multiple times in a playlist. This should be restricted.

Same track from same album, multiple copies of that in same playlist should be a complete NO-NO. 2. There is no option to find what podcasts you follow in mobile app. You should be able to see the podcast button on the same activity where it shows, artists, albums and songs.

While classical music is the most sophisticated choice for the listener (and the most appropriate rhythmic tool for brain development), trap rap motivates the listener to accomplish medial tasks. This would lead one to conclude that trap rap is most popular amongst younger generations, as the younger generations have essentially been forced into medial business roles, by no fault of their own.",0,,,

Clayton Bucher,"December 10, 2020",2,Spotify has always been awesome for me! I pay for Spotify premium and really enjoy the ability to be able to save music.

Really hoping this gets remidied sometime soon. Been frustratingly dealing with this for over a month. Will change star rating if it does :) deleting Spotify premium if it doesn't.,4,,,

Julio del Castillo,"December 10, 2020",2,"I have Spotify Premium. I think something broke with the recent update because the app no longer works with Android Auto.

The selected station shows only the last song played under normal mode regardless of your selection and the play controls for that song don't work. You can't play, fast forward or reverse that song. Interestedly enough the other station menus such as bringing up the station playlist shows the playlist from the station selected under normal mode. But selecting a song from the list has no effect. I've tried reinstalling Auto and Spotify and that didn't work. My Pandora App still works with AA but it's the free version and the ads are really annoying. And what the hell is up with the logins? I've had to change my password three times within a month because they stopped working. I backtracked and AA functionality broke after the 8-5-87-921.apk update.

Stuart Morgan,"December 9, 2020",2,Spotify is the worst thing to ever happen to podcasts. I have verizon wireless with phenomenal connection and service everywhere I go; even with full bars though spotify still buffers way too often on the Joe Rogan podcast. Every 2-5 minutes it buffers for 10+ seconds and it's ridiculous. It NEVER buffered on this phone while watching him on youtube. I really hope spotify ups their game or I think I'm going to have to cancel my family subscription again and just miss out on Joe Rogan now... 😕,2,,,

Keven Rall,"November 30, 2020",3,"I have been using Spotify for quite a while now and I have had a premium account for most of the time I have been using the app. I recently switched from a personal premium account to a family account since my mother wanted premium too and since then the app has become significantly worse. I used to be able to turn on my headphones, press play on them, and my music would start with no issue. Now I cannot do that. If I try to it says whatever song I had on when I stopped listening last at the exact time I stopped listening and does not change from there even though the app is clearly playing a different song. I have to close and reopen the app multiple times before it will function properly. When I click on the ""Your Library"" tab it takes much longer to load than it used to and when I click on the three dots next to a song the menu that is supposed to pop up frequently does not or takes very long and gives me a message saying that I am not connected to the internet whether I am on mobile data, on wifi with a stable internet connection, or if it's a song I have downloaded and should not require an internet connection. Recently, I can no longer like songs in my Daily Mix. I click the heart button and it does not fill green as it normally does, I receive no message saying it was added to my liked songs, and it does not show up in my liked songs. I love the service that Spotify provides and I use it on a daily basis as many people do, but the issues with the app on my Samsung Galaxy S9 makes the experience of using the app not as enjoyable as it used to be. I have not tried uninstalling and reinstalling since I have about 500 songs downloaded and would really prefer to not have to redownload those. If that is the fix for these issues then I will, but if it is not I will gladly do anything to try to fix these issues if there is a known solution.",925,,,

Also, sometimes my followed artists list will not display or takes a while to load. Have even uninstalled and reinstalled the app to try to fix it with no change.",1,,,
Pranshu Gadepalli,"November 30, 2020",4,"Amazing app but I think they need to cut down on the ads a little for the free version. When I played a song I got a pop-up saying watch a short video for 30 mins of uninterrupted music. I then closed that app and opened it again within a span of 5 mins to play another song and it started playing ads again. Moreover, when I click on ""no thanks"" when it asks me to watch the ads it still just plays the ad anyway.",16,,,
Seran Tamil,"December 12, 2020",3,"I totally love this app .but now a days it's like ads come after every song even if I watch ""watch this add for 30 mins of uninterrupted streaming"" like after every 3 minutes song I have to forcefully listen ads . Fix it pls .it's ok to listen that 30 minute uninterrupted streaming and watch ads 🙂",0,,,
Kasey Lapp,"November 19, 2020",1,"Been using Spotify premium for 6 odd years and the new algorithms have made it incredibly basic and unusable. I get the same 40 songs suggestions, albeit it in a different order, for every single song, radio and discovery/new playlist regardless of genre. I listen to almost every rock genre, folk, bluegrass, classical, EDM, blues, jazz, r'n'b, house, reggae, dub, funk, indie, grunge. Impossible to listen to new music now without spending hours looking for it. Algorithms maxed out = useless app.",15,,,
