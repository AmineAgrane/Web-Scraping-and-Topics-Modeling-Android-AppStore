DJ Pâtes,"December 31, 2020",3,"Had to install FB Lite to see if the things I posted went through because sometimes some error causes the post to be non-editable (if there's such a word). Also Lite is lower in resource impact when using the messenger feature since it is geared towards regions with limited access to 3G/4G/LTE networks. If the current Messenger has those same resource lite features, I'm all for it. Otherwise, it would be great if the Facebook app could auto-integrate with similar apps to streamline messaging.",1191,,,

Sophie Nicholson,"January 1, 2021",1,Complete pain in the arse to use. When you open a link it opens in a Facebook browser that has a messenger banner across the bottom so you can message whoever it is the link is for? Idk I've never used it.

Kill Matt,"December 31, 2020",5,Dark mode has finally become available for my model of phone. Love Facebook dark mode! I kept my word and gave the app five stars again. I still think there's way too many permissions. There is no reason why a social app should be able to access my microphone and Camera without my permission. It is an absolute privacy violation.,472,,,

I liked sharing and making awareness of news about crimes and missing teens to my newsfeed without having to see the negativity in my face everyday as it's triggering. Or just sharing things to my news feed that doesn't have to stay on my profile. App's getting lamer every update 🙄,275,,,

Jadd Gamby,"December 26, 2020",2,"Facebook was fun to use, easy to shop on. But sending money and receiving through messanger now is stupid. It asked me to verify my account and what not, wanted me to verify my address, my number, my phone, my ssn, and it wanted a picture of my license. Well I went in to setting to see why it wants me to do that and it said u should only do that if im a politician that wants to post ads or something similar, which I'm not. All of that stuff is new to Facebook that I've noticed. Please fix this",2130,,,
Wayne Kinder,"December 26, 2020",1,"I hate how the app updates itself whenever it likes, even though auto-updates are turned off on Google Play. It's the only app that does it, and it means if I'm typing something on Facebook at the time of the update I'll lose all I've typed as the app restarts itself. Some phones have the option built into the app to disable the updates but many, like mine, don't. Facebook need to allow the user to choose whether they want auto-update or not rather than forcing it on us.",430,,,

Jeanne Lee,"December 18, 2020",1,FB is in my opinion a Pitiful platform any more. The updates are the causes. Should have left it alone. Too much censorship.

You could have added some in-app incentive for people to check profiles and that way people would make more friends with common interests. Implementing larger profile photo picture icons in comments section of a post and the post itself can be a good start to attract the eye and click on a person's name to check it.,781,,,

But, facebook as a social media platform is a joke. The censorship is unconstitutional. The bias is obvious. I have been ""reprimanded"" by the powers that be at FB on multiple occasion, by sharing things I felt are important to share. I have NEVER been inappropriate, lewd or profane. I don't even curse on my page. I am being censored. Some posts that have been shared ""disappear"" and will no longer load or show. Others come up as ""false information"" when I KNOW it is TRUE, proven, factual information. Facebook should give us the freedom to post whatever we wish, within the guidelines and not censor or take down posts they don't like or agree with. It should be up to the people who share these to decide what they wasn't to see or hide or whatever, not the Facebook police.
